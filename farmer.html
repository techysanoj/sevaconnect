                                    launched by the Government of India for better employment and wealth creation for
                                    farmers or other citizens. The goal of government schemes for farmers in India is to

                                    in India.</span></p>

                                    purpose of improving and helping the livelihood for the people who need and provide
                                    a better life. Every scheme launches to provide privileges to the individuals in
                                    their life.&nbsp;</span></p>

                                    livelihood.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agriculture scheme for farmers is one of the most popular
                                    schemes and agriculture sectors of the Indian economy, giving livelihoods to a more
                                    significant part of India’s population. While providing food security is the
                                    foundation of the country’s rural economy. In the primary quarter of FY 2020-21,
                                    when the Indian economy registered 23.9 per cent negative development, farming was
                                    the only area that arose as a silver fixing for India’s monetary recuperation with
                                    over 3.4 per cent development. It makes farming the most noticeable area in the
                                    country. What’s more, it needs a ton of central government scheme to support a
                                    maintainable development in this manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
