                                        <p>A voter ID card entitles the possessor to vote in elections and elect
                                            officials to govern the country, create laws, and administer the country,
                                            state, or municipal government. The Indian Constitution grants the right to
                                            vote to all Indian citizens over the age of 18, subject to certain
                                            limitations. A voter identification card also functions as an official
                                            document for proving one's identity and address. You can use your voter ID
                                            card to register and vote in elections, as well as as an identity document
                                            when necessary. For these reasons, it is critical to ensure that the
                                            information on the ID card is current and accurate. If you've relocated, for
                                            example, you should update your voter identification card to reflect your
                                            new address. Your name must be added to the electoral roll in the
                                            constituency where you now live, and it must be withdrawn from the roll in
                                            the preceding constituency.</p>
                                        <p>The Indian Election Commission has made it easier to update your address on
                                            your voter ID card. Instead, then filling out multiple applications to add
                                            your name, update your address on your voter ID card, and delete your name
                                            from your previous constituency, you may now do it all on one form.</p><img
